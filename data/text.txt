Ans 1: It is the process of extracting graphical data within the platform, 
a wide range of visualisation and KPI for any application

> Adding pattern uncover
> Making decision 
> understanding KPI better

Ans 2: Regression 
> Predict continuous outcome
> Supervised
> Algo > Linear reg. 
>              Polynomial reg.
> eg:- Sales forecasting/ Stock price

Ex. Ans 3: Boosting is technique that classifier from classifier. It is done using weak model 

Clustering 
- Group similar type of data.
- Unsupervised 
- Algo - K means, DBscan

> eg: customer segmentation anomaly detection

can ensemble modeling attempts to build a strong the number of weak one by building a model by dell in series

Firstly a model is built from training data. Then the second model is build to correct the errors present in the first model.

Input ----> (with arrow pointing to "d")     [][][]
                                                             [][][]
                                                             [][][]
                                                              Output

"d" is updated in next step

Ans 4 > Spark helps in data a distributed computing for processing large and efficiently

speed > Sparks in memory fast data querying quick

Scalability = Can scale from to thousand of machine to handle datasets of 

Rich API's - Spark provides language Scala, Java, Python, R for data exploration by providing frameworks that allow volume of data

try processing allows for and analysing enabling 

on a single machine time allowing it to virtually any size

API's in multiple Scala, Java, Python, R explosion

Ans 5:
Multiclass 
> Single class per instance
> Classifying image: cats, dogs or birds
> evaluation matrices: Accuracy, precision recall, F1-score

Multilabel
> multiple class per instance 
> tagging a document with multiple topic or categories
> Hamming loss/precision

Types of classification
> Binary classification
> Multiclass classification
> multilabel classification
